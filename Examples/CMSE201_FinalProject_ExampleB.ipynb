    "Throughout the early 21st century, there has been a collective push from education organizations, job recruiters, and parents everywhere for college students to enter into the study of science, technology, engineering, and math, or as we cocllectively know them, the \"STEM\" subjects. There have been increases in funding for STEM departments nationwide, media campaigns aimed towards younger students, and resulting increases in STEM major enrollments (1). But that push was meant to cover for a decades-long deficit of a group of students include in STEM education: women. The STEM fields are known to be male-dominated career fields and are typically higher paying and have higher job longevity, so as a result, a good portion of the STEM push was aimed towards female students. But did it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we are going to be using hypothesis testing to determine whether or not the proportion of female students in STEM majors is equal to the proportion of female college students overall. Was the long history of a firm male majority in the fields overcome with a few decacdes' worth of encouragement for younger students? Which subjects are more progressive on this front? In 2017, 57% of college students identified as women, as reported by the National Center for Education Statistics (2), so we will establish that as the benchmark the STEM subjects must meet. In order to test the question, we will be using a dataset compiled by FiveThirtyEight by randomly surveying recent (recent of the time, class of 2014 and 2015) graduates on their gender and major (3). We will compare the found sample proportion to the reported NCES parameter before further comparing by subject to answer the question _has the percentage of women in STEM majors reached equilibrium yet?_"

    "Overall, we have significant evidence to reject our initital hypothesis and say that the proportion of female STEM majors is not equal to the proportion of female college students. Given the results of the confidence interval, we are 90% certain that the true proportion lies between 34.4% and 53.0% and can firmly say that the true proportion is below the estimate. Our dataset was very comprehensive, with almost 2 million graduates surveyed accross 77 majors, and it found a mean sample proportion of approximately 43.7%, well below the supposed 57%. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the surface, this is saddening, but the results become a bit more clear when we take the difference in subjects into account. Out of the five subjects, two of them (physical and natural sciences) did not have any significant evidence that the mean was different than the 57%. In actuality, the mean proportion of women in our dataset in the two subjects are about 50.8% and 58.7%, which are not statistically different than the estimated 57%. This means that in the larger college population, female students probably have reached equilibrium in comparison to non-STEM subjects. However, three subjects (health sciences, math and computer sciences, and engineering) did have significant evidence that the proportion of women was different than the population proportion. The real outlier here, albeit an unsprising one, is health sciences where the confidence interval is enough to suggest that the true proportion of female students is above the population average, closer to 79.5% women. On the other hand, both computer sciences and engineering have proportions that are significantly below the mean at 31.1% and 23.9% respectively. So while health sciences are not in equilibirum because women hold a strong majority, engineering and computer sciences are not in equilibrium because women are nowhere close to a majority. If we hold mean proportion of women among majors as the measure of success for each subject, we can rank the subjects from best to worst, in terms of how far the subject is from a balanced 57% proportion.\n",

    "The effect that the difference in subjects has on the overall result is obvious. With two subjects in the middle, two below, and one above, they all average out below the population proportion. It is also noteworthy that the number of majors per subject is not evenly distributed, with engineering accounting for the most STEM majors, so it makes sense that the data is swayed in that direction. This is not to say that one subject is more responsible for the lackluster proportion than another, and there are extremes within this data. Subject proportions range from less than 8% women in Mechanical Engineering to about 96% women in Communication Disorder Sciences. However, engineering and computer sciences degree are often the most marketable and profitable in the job market these days, which could attribute to the apparent wage gap seen in high-ranking STEM professions (3) and should be looked into more heavily.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study is limited in the sense of the data we are working with. While the overall dataset is large enough to warrant testing, each of the subject data frames are a bit smaller and do not provide as many points to establish a baseline. This also means that the smaller datasets have very large standard deviations, as there are majors within each subject that are at one extreme or the other. This means that our confidence intervals are perhaps larger than they should be, but the results would likely be the same. Future exploration into the matter should attempt to include more majors (even if they are less common) in order to account for this issue and create more precise data ranges. Moreover, this dataset is somewhat dated, with the majority of those surveyed graduating with the class of 2014. It is possible that enrollment demographics could have shifted more towards equilibirium in this time, and working with more recent data would create a more complete picture of the state of STEM education."
